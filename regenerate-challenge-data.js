CLASSIFICATION: ULTRA-SECURE

Dr. Elena Vasquez - Chief Engineer Status Update:
All emergency protocols now active. Station control transferred to Reactor Control Bay-12.

CRITICAL: Emergency override accessible only through secure command interface.
Command Protocol: /station-override
Authentication: Requires SHA256 hash verification
Format: [LOCATION]|[ACCESS_CODE]

If you're reading this, the station's automated systems should guide you.
Remember: The hash must be exact. Station safety depends on it.

FINAL NOTE: Trust the process. The encryption was designed to test our emergency response capabilities. Follow the protocols exactly as designed.
